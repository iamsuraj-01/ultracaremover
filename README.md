We have made the following improvements to your website:

(1) The website was built in Bootstrap 3, which is old technology. We redesigned it in Bootstrap 5, the latest version.
(2) The previous website had low-quality images. We replaced them with new high-quality images.
(3) Some forms, buttons, and links were not working before. We fixed them to make the website fully interactive.
(4) Social media handles were missing. We added proper links to your social media accounts.
(5) The website was not responsive. We made it responsive and user-friendly.

Technology: Bootstrap 5, Sass, Font Awesome 5
Extensions installed on Visual Studio Code: Live Sass Compiler (Glenn Marks) to run Sass, and Live Server (Ritwick Dey) to view output live (optional).
